# Exoplanet-Identification-with-Machine-Learning
Exoplanets are celestial bodies located beyond our solar system. Identifying exoplanets is crucial for discovering habitable planets and potential extraterrestrial life. Various techniques are employed to locate exoplanets. This algorithm specifically targets the detection of patterns in light fluctuations, which can indicate the presence of planetary systems. It utilizes CNN and Decision Tree algorithms to identify these patterns. 

The dataset used consists of the light flux levels of several thousand stars captured during the Kepler Space Campaign-3. This dataset is publicly available and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data
